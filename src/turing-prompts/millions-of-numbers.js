/* Instructions
You are given three arrays of equal size. Each array has 1 million RANDOM integer values.

Assume that each array is already sorted in ascending order and that no individual array has any duplicate values.

Your goal is to write a method/function that will return an array of any/all values which are present in all three arrays.

Bonus: Once youâ€™ve found a working solution, try to optimize to run in O(n) time and 1x space complexity.

Small Scale Example Below 

Small Scale Example:
 nums1 = [1, 2, 4, 5, 8]
    nums2 = [2, 3, 5, 7, 9]
    nums3 = [1, 2, 5, 8, 9]
    findMatches(nums1, nums2, nums3)
    => [2, 5]
    

nums = [1,2,3,4]

/* Psuedocode
GOAL: return an array of any/all values which are present in all three arrays.
INPUT: 3 arrays of equal size
  - as variable so that we can iterate over them?
OUTPUT: array of any/all values which are present in all three arrays
HOW: 
- iterate through each array
- compare each value to the other arrays
- return the value if it is present in all arrays (includes)
METHODS:
- filter?  
  - with includes
- reduce?
  - this might work, but feels really thick for the logic
