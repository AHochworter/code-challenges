/* FROM DEVIN
Write a function findMajorityElement that takes an array of integers 
and returns the element that appears more than n/2 times in the array, 
where n is the size of the array. If there is no such element, the function should return null.

Input: [3, 3, 4, 2, 4, 4, 2, 4, 4]
Output: 4 (because 4 appears 5 times which is more than 9/2 times)*/

const findMajorityElement = () => {
  console.log('Find Majority Element');
};

export default findMajorityElement;
